## Dataset [FairFedMed]((https://drive.google.com/open?id=11SrLJQdKwA3ELEnebTzlmZGadcxnGIiv&usp=drive_fs)) 

You can download [FairFedMed](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11SrLJQdKwA3ELEnebTzlmZGadcxnGIiv&usp=drive_fs) dataset (56GB) from our official [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11SrLJQdKwA3ELEnebTzlmZGadcxnGIiv&usp=drive_fs). It consists of paired 2D SLO fundus images and 3D OCT B-Scans from 15,165 patients for glaucoma detection, along with six different demographic attributes: age, gender, race, ethnicity, preferred language, and
marital status.

## Methodology [(FairFedLoRA)](trainers/GLP_OT_SVLoRA.py)
Comparison of three federated learning pipelines: (a) the fully parameter-updated FL, (b) the prompt learning-based FL, and (c) our proposed FairFedLoRA.

### [Model Training](scripts/fairfedlora_fairfedmed.sh)
Download the above dataset first, then run the following code:
```
# 2D SLO images
sh scripts/fairfedlora_fairfedmed.sh       # ViT-B/16 backbone
sh scripts/fairfedlora_fairfedmed_rn50.sh  # ResNet50 backbone
# 3D OCT B-Scan images
sh scripts/fairfedlora_fairfedmed_oct.sh       # ViT-B/16 backbone
sh scripts/fairfedlora_fairfedmed_oct_rn50.sh  # ResNet50 backbone
```

### [Evaluation Metrics](evaluation/evaluator_oph.py)

### Experimental Results

We compare FairFedLoRA with traditional fully parameter-updated methods, including [FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11375) and [FedHEAL](https://github.com/yuhangchen0/FedHEAL), as well as prompt learning-based models, such as [PromptFL](https://github.com/PEILab-Federated-Learning/PromptFL) and [FedOTP](https://github.com/HongxiaLee/FedOTP), both based on [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). 

In summary, the experimental results highlight the effectiveness of FairFedLoRA in improving both performance and fairness compared to existing FL models. While traditional fully parameter-updated FL methods achieve strong overall accuracy, they fail to ensure fairness across diverse demographic groups. Prompt-learning-based FL models show improved fairness but suffer from a decline in performance due to limitations in adapting to medical imaging data. FairFedLoRA, on the other hand, strikes a balance between high classification performance and enhanced fairness across race, language, and ethnicity attributes. This makes it a promising approach for ensuring both high accuracy and equitable outcomes in fairness-aware medical FL tasks.
